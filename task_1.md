## Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

Since the client, the owner of the game shop, is enthusiastic and open to any kind of games, I think it is his will to leave the game development to the developer. Also, is request was to build up a new game, which revives his passion for text-based games, so that means the game has to be new to him and can even surprise him in a good way. Therefore, it would be best to show the product after all the game programming has been done.

## Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

As I mentioned in the answer of the question 1, the client proposed all the conditions on the game and said nothing upon that. It means that I can assume he accepts any game that those conditions are fulfilled. However, from the view of professional molarity, I have to do all my best to fulfill the client's need and then I might need to utillize the idea of MPVs for that. In my case, the first step of MPV would be the basic idea of the game, such as the genre, system and so on. Other than that, there should also be the MPVs for usability, story and settings.

## Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software?

I found a similarity between them in terms of their common feature that they repeats the same process many times to achieve the goal. Also, both cycles value feedbacks given by the clients and redo the process until the client is satisfied.

## What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

As an instance of a simplest principle for human-centered design, the design should clearly indicate the user how to use it. For example, just as the video menitoned, a plenty of people are struggling with whether push or pull a door in front of them. This is obviously a misconception of the design, and the idea of human-centered design is to fix this kind of inconvinience.

## Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Playersâ€™ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas.

When considering an application of human-centered design to my game, it reaches the plateau of the limitation of text-based game. Text-based game cannot be as user-friendly as normal video games in terms of visualization of centents at any cost. Therefore, I might have to consider a mixture of them to increase the usability of the game.

    print("TRUE")
elif x+y==10:
    print("TRUE")
