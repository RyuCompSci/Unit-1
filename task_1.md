## Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

Since the client, the owner of the game shop, is enthusiastic and open to any kind of games, I think it is his will to leave the game development to the developer. Also, is request was to build up a new game, which revives his passion for text-based games, so that means the game has to be new to him and can even surprise him in a good way. Therefore, it would be best to show the product after all the game programming has been done.

## Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

As I mentioned in the answer of the question 1, the client proposed all the conditions on the game and said nothing upon that. It means that I can assume he accepts any game that those conditions are fulfilled. However, from the view of professional molarity, I have to do all my best to fulfill the client's need and then I might need to utillize the idea of MPVs for that. In my case, the first step of MPV would be the basic idea of the game, such as the genre, system and so on. Other than that, there should also be the MPVs for usability, story and settings.

## Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software?
