### What is the purpose of the success criteria?

To create a product that fits initial needs and reqirements and not to go off track for the goal in middle of the project.

### What do you now understand about computer/computer science?

Coding or programming itself is not everything about computer science, but computational thinking and design thinking is essential for this area of study and even for daily lives.

### What do you now understand yourself that you did not before unit 1?

I understand now that I tend not to follow the initial plans that I made at the very beginning of project because when i have got a new idea, I always go for that impulsively.

### What worked well during the development of unit 1?

When I got stuck on a question in Snakify, it often worked well that I take some break for a while and try to seek out a way to look at the question from different view point.

### What did not work well during the development of unit 1?

Every time I apply new functions, it always did not work well at first.

### A developper is only responsible for the successs criteria? Agree or disagree?

As long as meeting the reqirements and wants of the clients, a developper only has to be responsible for the success criteria. Clients' wishes should always be prioritized to anything, so if the developper finds something that covers the clients' needs which is not included in the success criteria, it is ideal to enhanse or fix that.
